# Goals That May Be A Waste Of Time And Resources

## Context

1. Having the best stuff - clothes, cars, technology, and similar.
2. Having the most money. Being the most successful.
3. Being famous / Having a lasting impact / Being known for something.
4. Being liked by everybody.
5. Getting things done every day.
6. Focusing on perfection.
7. It is not what you can do with the money, it is about how comfortable it is to have it.

## Problems

1. Nobody cares. Even if people judge you, should you really care? How much do you value their opinion?
2. Someone is always going to be ahead of you.
3. You won't be remembered. Your work might.
4. This is not achievable.
5. Causes unnecessary stress and fictional obligation. Don't forget about burnout.
6. Things do not get done.
7. Fancy things have no added value besides status.

## Solution

1. Allocate more resources on the things you actually care about and use on a daily basis.
2. Focus on the progression towards the goal, not on achieving it. Compare yourself to where you want to be in `10` years.
3. Focus on long-term relationships - family and friends.
4. Focus on making the right things; focus on truth.
5. Focus on the day itself - there's no need to do stuff every single day.
6. Iterative improvement.
7. Having savings. Focus on having comfort that if something goes wrong, you can react.

## Benefits

1. You own your stuff. Your stuff does not own you.
2. Increased and non-delayed happiness while following goals.
3. You are there for the people that need you the most.
4. You make decisions that may be tough, but are the right thing to do.
5. Less stress, slow productivity. Doing what you like vs doing what you have to do.
6. Things get accomplished and through iterative improvement the final result is even better than what could have been if focus on perfection was put in the first place.
7. You learn how to keep more money, not spend more money.

## Todo for oneself

1. Think carefully about the consequences and reasons when allocating time and resources to anything.
2. Try to enjoy and have fun while you're doing anything as this is what's important, not just the end result.
3. Be present for your closest people - family and friends (not just sitting in a car with them or having phone calls, actually being there).
4. Focus on what is right, not what will make you most *liked*.
5. Every holiday, plan a day when nothing is being accomplished.
6. Perfect something iteratively, not from the first try.
7. Learn how to save money.
8. Don't buy something right away - wait it out.
