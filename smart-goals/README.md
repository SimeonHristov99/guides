# On Goal Setting

## Context

- `S`: Specific. Vague goals are not goals. They are desires.
- `M`: Measurable. How will you know you've achieved it? You have to be able to answer whether you've achieved you goal with `Yes` or `No` and other people can confirm that.
- `A`: Attainable. Ensure that what you're setting can actually be done.
- `R`: Realistic. Ensure that they are no other prerequisites. Ensure that work can start right away.
- `T`: Timely. A time frame is assembled during which the goal accomplishing process takes place.

## Problems

- The SMART goal setting process is definitely useful for managing teams in a business, but it may fall short for personal development. The principles would need an extension to cover it.
- Realistic goals tend to limit one, when they are setting goals for personal development. They may become mediocre and too *small* for the potential one has.

## Solution

For personal goal setting, the following guidelines can be used:

1. Specific.
2. Big / Huge. They have to be inspiring and compelling. They need to get you excited, fire-up and motivated.
3. Aligned with what you like. You have to really want to see them achieved. The goals should be connected with your top values and top feelings.
4. Visualize your goals: write it down and review it regularly.

## Benefits

You can excel both at work and at life.
