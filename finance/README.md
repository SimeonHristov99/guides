# Finance

## Guidelines

1. The 50/20/30 rule:
   - `50%` of your income goes to **needs**: rent, food, bills, transportation, insurance, etc. Your necessary stuff.
   - `20%` of your income goes to **financial goals**: saving, investing, paying off debt, etc. Actions that move you closer to financial freedom.
   - `30%` of your income goes to **fun**: takeout budget, gaming setup, weekend trips, holidays, etc.
2. Good investments should put you to sleep. The best investments are boring.
   - Buy index funds, i.e. `S&P 500`.
   - Invest automatically. Set up a recurring investments - weekly, monthly, etc., so that you don't have to think about them.
   - Leave it alone. Don't check it constantly.
3. Spend money on the stuff you love. Cut costs on the things you don't.

## Todo for oneself

- [ ] Take your monthly income and divide it into the above percentiles to get a sense of what you have available for a month.
- [ ] Take your yearly income and divide it into the above percentiles to get a sense of what you have available for a year.
