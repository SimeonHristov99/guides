## Definitions

- **Financial Literacy**: knowing how to handle your money wisely.
  - While budgeting is a key part of financial literacy, it is only one aspect. Financial literacy also involves understanding things like interest rates, credit scores, and investment strategies.
  - While saving money is an important part of financial literacy, it is not the only thing you should be doing. Investing your money can be a great way to grow your wealth over time. Additionally, it is important to be aware of the different types of accounts and products available to you, so you can choose the one that best meets your needs.
- **Budget**: a plan that helps you manage your money.
  - It shows you how much money you have, how much money you need to spend on different things, and how much money you can save or use for other goals.
- **Income**: the money you earn or receive from different sources, like your allowance, gifts, or jobs.
- **Expense**: the money you spend on different things, like food, clothes, bills, or entertainment.
- **Debt**: money you owe to someone else, like a bank, a store, or a friend.
  - can be a problem because it can cost you more money in interest and fees, damage your credit score, or cause stress and conflict with friends and family.
- **Fixed Expenses**: expenses that are the same every month, such as your rent, car payment, insurance, or cell phone bill.
- **Variable Expenses**: expenses that can vary from month-to-month, like some utilities, groceries, or shopping.
- **Planned expenses**: expenses that are predictable and occur on a repeating basis.
- **Interest**: Money the bank gives you for trusting them to look after your money. The more money you have in your account, and the longer you keep it there, the more interest you can earn.

## Budgeting and saving

### Budgeting

- Track your income and expenses.
- Set and achieve your goals (saving for a bike, a college fund, or a vacation).
- Avoid or reduce debt.
- Avoid borrowing money you don't have a clear plan for repaying.
- Ways of building a budget:
  - Pencil and paper.
  - Spreadsheet.
  - Printable sheets on the Internet: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v03IeaDHOe4hHtpKdKTOVkmRVvxsMcpO/view>.
  - Apps: `Empower`, `YNAB`, `Mobills`.
- Use the `50:30:20` rule.
- Having a negative balance in your budget means that the income you brought in was not enough the cover the expenses. To tackle this problem you can either try to increase your income or reduce your expenses. Even better if you can accomplish both.
- Ways to increase your income:
  - Ask for a raise or more hours at your current job.
  - Look for extra jobs or chores that you can do for money, such as babysitting, mowing lawns, or selling crafts.
  - Sell things you don't use or need anymore, such as clothes, books, or toys.
  - Save your change and cash it in at a bank or a coin machine.
  - Ask for money or gift cards as a gift for your birthday or other occasions.
- Some ways to save money on expenses are:
  - Compare prices and look for discounts or coupons before you buy something.
  - Avoid impulse buying, which means buying things you don't need or didn't plan to buy.
  - Use less water, electricity, and gas to lower your utility bills.
  - Borrow, swap, or reuse items instead of buying new ones.
  - Pack your lunch instead of buying it outside.
  - Choose free or low-cost activities for fun, such as reading, playing games, or going to the park.
  - A short term fix to a negative budget balance is to simply move funds from the budget balance that was positive into the negative one.
    - For example, if your savings budget balance was negative, but your needs budget balance was positive, you can take the extra money from needs and move it onto savings.
    - Note that this is only a short-term solution, and we should really try and figure out the cause of the negative balance.
  - Negotiate a lower bill with your service providers.
- You have a monthly income of $\$3,000$‍. How much of your monthly income should you save of invest for your future?
- Follow-up tasks:
  - [ ] Take your monthly income and divide it into the above percentiles to get a sense of what you have available for a month.
  - [ ] Take your yearly income and divide it into the above percentiles to get a sense of what you have available for a year.
  - [ ] Create a budget following the `50:30:20` rule.

### Per unit pricing

- Per unit pricing tells you how much you're paying per ounce, per pound, or per item.
- Paying attention to per unit pricing can help you figure out which product is the best deal.
- If you're shopping for toilet paper, you might see two different brands. One costs ‍$$5.99$ for $12$ rolls, while the other costs ‍$$7.99$ for $18$ rolls.
- It appears that the first option is the best deal, but if you compare per unit pricing, you'll see that the second option is actually cheaper:
  - The first option costs ‍$$0.50$ per roll.
  - The second option costs only ‍$$0.44$ per roll.
- Follow-up tasks:
  - [ ] Next time you see conflicting prices, look at the price per unit, not the total price.

### Emergency fund

- `3` to `6` months of your needed expenditure.
  - If your needs are `$2000`, then save up `$6000` to `$12000` in an emergency fund.
- Follow-up tasks:
  - [ ] Calculate what amount you need for the emergency fund and start saving it.

### Paying yourself first

- Prioritizing saving over needs and wants, not the other way around.
- A strategy to prioritize saving and investing for your financial goals.

### Savings accounts

A savings account is a great way to save money, earn interest, and grow your wealth over time.

- Traditional savings account: A traditional savings account is the most common type of savings account. Banks will usually offer you a small amount of interest for keeping your money with them. Interest rates are typically low, but these accounts are usually a great place to start, as they are easy to open and come with no fees.
- High-yield savings account: A high-yield savings account usually offers a higher interest rate than a traditional savings account. This can be a good option if you want to grow your money faster, but there may be some restrictions, such as a minimum balance requirement or withdrawal limits.
- Money market account: A money market account is a type of savings account that usually has a higher interest rate than a traditional savings account. You may be able to write checks from a money market account but these accounts may also have fees.
- Certificate of deposit (CD): A CD is a type of savings account where you agree to keep your money with the bank for a certain amount of time (a couple of months to a couple of years). In return, the bank will give you a higher interest rate. If you withdraw your money before the time is up, you may have to pay a penalty.

## Consumer credit

### Payment methods

- Cash: A good option if you want to avoid overspending, as you're limited to the amount you have on hand. However, carrying large amounts of cash can be risky, and you won't be able to make large purchases this way.
- Debit cards: Pull money directly from your bank account, so you don't have to worry about incurring interest charges like you would with a credit card. Note that some debit card transactions can take a few days to process, which can make it difficult to keep track of your account balance.
- Credit cards: Allow you to borrow money to make purchases, which can be helpful if you don't have the funds readily available. Some credit cards offer rewards like cash back or travel points. However, if you don't pay your bill in full each month, **you'll be charged interest on your outstanding balance**. Credit cards can also be a temptation to overspend, which can lead to accumulating debt.
- Rent-to-Own: Consumers can take home items like furniture, electronics, or appliances, and make weekly or monthly payments on them until they are paid off. Rent-to-own stores usually do not require a credit check, which makes them a popular option for people with bad credit. However, consumers should be aware that they usually end up paying much more for items than they would if they bought them outright.
- Store Credit: Many retailers offer store credit (or in-store financing), which lets consumers buy items and pay for them over time. Store credit can come in the form of a line of credit (like a credit card), or an installment plan, where consumers make fixed monthly payments over a set period of time. For example, if you buy a new TV from a store that offers store credit, you can pay for it in $12$ monthly installments. While some stores offer zero-interest financing, others may charge interest or fees.
- Installment Agreements: An installment agreement is a type of contract that lets a consumer buy a product or service and pay for it over time. It is similar to store credit, but it can be used for a wider range of purchases. For example, you might use an installment agreement to buy a car, pay for a medical procedure, or even finance a vacation. With an installment agreement, you agree to make fixed monthly payments for a set period of time, usually with interest.
- Layaway: A customer can reserve an item they want to buy, and make payments towards the total cost over time. For example, if you want to buy a TV that costs $$500$ but you do not have the full amount at the time. With layaway, you can pay for the TV by paying a certain amount each week or month until you've paid the full retail cost. Once you've paid in full, you can take the TV home.
