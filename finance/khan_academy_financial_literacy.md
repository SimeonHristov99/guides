## Definitions

- **Financial Literacy**: knowing how to handle your money wisely.
  - While budgeting is a key part of financial literacy, it is only one aspect. Financial literacy also involves understanding things like interest rates, credit scores, and investment strategies.
  - While saving money is an important part of financial literacy, it is not the only thing you should be doing. Investing your money can be a great way to grow your wealth over time. Additionally, it is important to be aware of the different types of accounts and products available to you, so you can choose the one that best meets your needs.
- **Budget**: a plan that helps you manage your money.
  - It shows you how much money you have, how much money you need to spend on different things, and how much money you can save or use for other goals.
- **Income**: the money you earn or receive from different sources, like your allowance, gifts, or jobs.
- **Expense**: the money you spend on different things, like food, clothes, bills, or entertainment.
- **Debt**: money you owe to someone else, like a bank, a store, or a friend.
  - can be a problem because it can cost you more money in interest and fees, damage your credit score, or cause stress and conflict with friends and family.
- **Fixed Expenses**: expenses that are the same every month, such as your rent, car payment, insurance, or cell phone bill.
- **Variable Expenses**: expenses that can vary from month-to-month, like some utilities, groceries, or shopping.

## Unit 2: Budget

- Avoid borrowing money you don't have a clear plan for repaying.
- Ways of building a budget:
  - Pencil and paper.
  - Spreadsheet.
  - Printable sheets on the Internet: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v03IeaDHOe4hHtpKdKTOVkmRVvxsMcpO/view>.
  - Apps: `Empower`, `YNAB`, `Mobills`.
- Use the `50:30:20` rule.
- Having a negative balance in your budget means that the income you brought in was not enough the cover the expenses. To tackle this problem you can either try to increase your income or reduce your expenses. Even better if you can accomplish both.
- Ways to increase your income:
  - Ask for a raise or more hours at your current job.
  - Look for extra jobs or chores that you can do for money, such as babysitting, mowing lawns, or selling crafts.
  - Sell things you don't use or need anymore, such as clothes, books, or toys.
  - Save your change and cash it in at a bank or a coin machine.
  - Ask for money or gift cards as a gift for your birthday or other occasions.
- Some ways to save money on expenses are:
  - Compare prices and look for discounts or coupons before you buy something.
  - Avoid impulse buying, which means buying things you don't need or didn't plan to buy.
  - Use less water, electricity, and gas to lower your utility bills.
  - Borrow, swap, or reuse items instead of buying new ones.
  - Pack your lunch instead of buying it outside.
  - Choose free or low-cost activities for fun, such as reading, playing games, or going to the park.
  - A short term fix to a negative budget balance is to simply move funds from the budget balance that was positive into the negative one.
    - For example, if your savings budget balance was negative, but your needs budget balance was positive, you can take the extra money from needs and move it onto savings.
    - Note that this is only a short-term solution, and we should really try and figure out the cause of the negative balance.
- You have a monthly income of $\$3,000$‚Äç. How much of your monthly income should you save of invest for your future?
