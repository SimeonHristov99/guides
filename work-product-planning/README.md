# Creating a (five-year) plan for a product

## Structure

1. What are we trying the achieve?
    - This is the **Business vision**.
    - Example: "empowering the use of data (explain what data will be used) to unlock insights (explain what insights will be obtained) and drive better decision-making".
2. How are we going to achieve it?
    - This is the **Product vision**. It should be expressed as strategic directions which would bring the added value.
    - Example:
      - Direction 1: scale to global markets
      - Direction 2: address more use-cases
      - Direction 3: integration with more platforms
      - Direction 4: scalable and cost-effective solutions with higher RoI
        ...
3. When are we going to achieve it?
   - This is the **Product strategy**. This is the place to define year/quarter/month/day plans.
