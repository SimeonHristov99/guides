# On Following One's Passion

## Context

People who land on a dream job often compel younger students to follow their dreams:

- Those who make the biggest ripples, are the ones that are fueled by passion.
- Life is much more enjoyable if you can find something that you love doing (spending a lot of time doing something is how you get good at it).
- You have freedom of choice: don't be shackled by societal constraints.

## Problems

1. Not everyone has a **pre-baked dream**, waiting to be followed.
2. This approach is self-centered - you're viewing the world from the lens of what you personally enjoy, not giving a weight on how exactly that would **add value to others**.
3. When you're a student the fundamental goal is to learn/grow/become better. In life after graduation, success = the amount of value you add to others.
4. Assumes there is one static target point. There will be unpredictable changes.
5. The moment something becomes boring, it stops being a passion.

## Solution

- If you have a passion that you want to incorporate into a career, taka a step back and recognize that this is a passion that grew when the goal was to learn and to grow, but you are transitioning into a period where the goal shifts to adding value to others.
- Action precedes motivation.
  - you feel awake after getting out of bed, not before.
  - a drive to exercise comes from exercising.
- Timing. It's not just about the odds of winning a particular game. It's about whether the game you choose to play meshes well with the way the future unfolds.
- Ask yourself: *What is possible now, that was not possible 10 years ago and which might get harder 10 years from now?*.
  - There are more opportunities in a less crowded landscape.
  - There are more chances to grow if you're part of a rising tide.
  - Consider following a path that has little to no precedent.
- Rather than having one particular goal that identifies who you are, remain nimble and responsive to the changes in the world.
- What will see you through is not passion, but the sense of deep connection to what you're doing.

## Benefits

- The dreams you have become something more than just yourself and provide value to others.
- People who excel in their job make life easier for others around them.
- People who excel is PhD programs are the ones who recognize how their work fits into the broader research community (not the ones who view it as the next chapter in university).
- The successful entrepreneurs are the ones that sell what people want to buy (not the ones that are looking to make something impressive).

## Todo for oneself

- Start thinking of success in terms of the amount of value added to others.
- Whenever you think of something new, analyze how much value it brings and to whom.
