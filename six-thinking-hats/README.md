# On Goal Setting

## Context

You're presenting an architecture design to an architecture review board at your company.

## Problems

They ask: *Can we see the other concepts you worked on?*. You haven't though of any. You present the only idea you've worked on.

## Solution

### Six thinking hats

- A system designed in the 1980s by Edward de Bono.
- Essence: wear different imaginary `hats`. Each hat represents different mindset/emotion.

#### Blue hat

- Management.
- Define idea outlines at the start.
- Draw conclusions at the end.
- Look at the big picture.

#### White hat

- Facts and data.
- Establish relevant facts and information about your idea.
- *What is the concept in its basic form?*
- *What it its purpose?*
- *Who does it serve?*

#### Yellow hat

- Positivity and value.
- *What is great about your idea?*
- *What benefits would it bring?*
- Look for the true value in your concept.

#### Red hat

- Emotion.
- Use your gut feeling.
- *How does this makes me feel?*
- *What is my reaction when I first see this idea?*
- *What would viewers who have never seen this idea think of it?*

#### Black hat

- Negativity.
- Apply the pre-mortem technique.
- *Why wouldn't my idea work?*
- *What are the issues and flaws?*
- *What are the drawbacks?*

#### Green hat

- Creativity.
- *What can be improved?*
- *What can be reiterated?*
- *Is there a completely fresh idea forming in your head?*

## Benefits

- You can look at an idea from various angles, focusing on different aspects each time.
- A way to critique ideas.
- Allows you to be creative and bold while forcing you to be honest and realistic.
- Can be used to form a pitch.
- Helps you realize the following: *Even if you're charged up about an idea, even if you've run through it in your head a hundred times, sketched out a logo, and prepared to release it to the wold, acclaim: **that idea may still suck!***

### Example: Evaluating an idea

- Context: Pizza orders are received through phone calls. Then, they are entered into the system manually.
- Problem: This leads to wrong entries.
- Proposed solution: You propose to forbid orders through phone calls.

- Blue hat:
  - explains the goal of the meeting.
- White hat:
  - 80% of the orders are online and 20% are by phone call.
  - if we implement the idea, 90% will switch over to online and 10% will stop working with us.
  - finance projects a 2% loss in sales = 50K yearly.
- Yellow hat:
  - we'll save 2 hours a day manual labor.
  - we'll speed up regular system updates by 40%.
  - we'll receive less customer complaints about wrong entries.
  - customer satisfaction will increase.
  - we'll save $60K in returns and chargebacks.
- Black hat:
  - we'll lose loyal customers.
  - we'll need more communication budget to explain this decision to our customers.
- Green hat:
  - we'll lose 50K, but save 60K. That means we can use the additional 10K as communication budget.
  - we can create a comprehensive online tutorial about how to order online.
- Blue hat:
  - summarizes the discussions.
  - plans next steps.
