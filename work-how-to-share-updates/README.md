# How to share updates

## Context

- You're required to share progress on a task.
- You work on a task that is important to you.

## Problems

- You're required to provide an update daily / $n$ times a week.
- You get demotivated because you're loosing track of what is being done, what should be done, anything new that popped up and needs addressing.
- You don't feel like progressing.

## Solution

- Keep it simple, concise, results/delivery-oriented.
- Create a plan first: it'll become the single source or truth that logs what you did during the work on the task.

### Structure

1. What I did (yesterday / these past few days / this week, etc)?
2. What are the results (any encountered blockers go here, i.e. you discuss positive and negative results)?
3. What are my next steps?

## Resources

- My own experience.
